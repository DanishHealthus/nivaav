    {
      title: "How is a Nerve Block performed?",
      desc: "A Nerve Block is performed in the operation theatre, under local anaesthesia. A doctor first applies anaesthesia to numb the skin and deep tissues. Once anesthetised, an X-ray machine called Fluoroscope is used to guide a needle close to the affected nerve root. The doctor then injects a contrast medium to confirm the needle positioning and then administers a small amount of local anaesthesia and steroids around the nerve root. The anaesthesia blocks the pain signal temporarily, and the steroids help reduce the inflammation in that area.",
