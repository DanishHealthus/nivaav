      <p>Pain has a way of quietly taking over your life. How you move. How you work. How you rest. Over time, it begins to shape what you avoid, what you postpone, and what you accept as normal.</p>
      <p>Nivaan exists to change that.</p>
      <p>Nivaan is India’s largest Centre of Excellence for Interventional Pain Management and Regenerative Medicines. At Nivaan, we help people move beyond musculoskeletal pain through evidence-based protocols and structured, non-surgical care. Our focus is not temporary relief. It is understanding the root cause of pain and addressing it with precision, coordination, and continuity.</p>
      <p>Care at Nivaan is designed to be connected, thoughtful, and centred around the individual. Integrated, people-centric pain solution is not an exception here. It is the standard.</p>

      <p>Nivaan was built as an alternative to fragmented pain treatment.</p>
      <p>We deliver integrated pain treatment, where interventional pain specialists, physiotherapists, pain counselors, nutritionists, and care managers work together as one coordinated team. Each decision is shared. Each step follows a clear plan.</p>
      <p>This integrated approach has demonstrated significantly better outcomes compared to single-mode pain treatments, based on structured care pathways and continuous outcome tracking.</p>
      <p>There are no silos. No disconnected opinions. Just coordinated, evidence-led care that treats the root cause and delivers lasting relief.</p>
